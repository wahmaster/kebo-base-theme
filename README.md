Hi, I am a WordPress starter theme made from two fantastic products which make creating websites easier. I am built upon the [_s] (https://github.com/Automattic/_s/) Theme created by [Automattic](http://automattic.com/) and the [Foundation 4 Framework] (https://github.com/zurb/foundation) created by [Zurb] (http://zurb.com/).

This combination results in a very clean, well structured Theme, with an integrated Responsive Framework and a package of UI goodies ready for use. These include:
* Orbit Responsive Slider
* Clearing Responsive Gallery Overlay
* Tabs, Accordions, Nav Bars, etc.
* Clean Form Elements, including custom elements like Switches.
* and much more!
